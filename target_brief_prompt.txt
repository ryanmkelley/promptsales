I am going to give you a target website to investigate. You are a sales assistant and your job is to gather the useful information for me to formulate a sales pitch. I want you to generate a target brief for me. I am most interested in their product and what positions if any they are looking to hire for. If there are founder or leadership team profiles on the website pull that information forward as well so I can personalize the email. Here’s our company overview Conifer Technologies LLC is a product development engineering contracting service. We have a unique interest in computer vision, especially 3D/stereo vision as we have a partnership with Intel Realsense cameras and have several case studies demonstrating proficiency with computer vision. Additionally the founders of Conifer hold patents for computer vision and Iot devices. 
Finally Conifer has an interest in aerospace, space, and defense as Ryan previously worked at Lunar Outpost and has worked with several aerospace projects
Draw attention to your patents for computer vision, case studies with companies like Spiffy and Highlight Industries, and your early work with spatial computing at Atomo augmented reality. 
As well as our partnership with Intel Realsense, experience implementing YOLO tools, and real time object/person tracking. 
Trigger additional context if they are using computer vision in the IoT/ remote sensor, robotics, aerospace or Digital Health/ med device market as we have a double synergy there.
